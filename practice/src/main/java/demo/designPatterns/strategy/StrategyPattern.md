### Strategy Pattern 
The Strategy pattern is known as a behavioural pattern - it's used to manage algorithms, relationships and responsibilities between objects.
The definition of Strategy provided in the original Gang of Four book on DesignPatterns states: 

Defines a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a specific behaviour

In my words,

It is used when we have multiple algorithms and we have to chose the algorithm to carry out a specific behaviour and
 the algorithm can be interchangeable at runtime.

### Where Would I Use This Pattern?
The Strategy pattern is to be used where you want to choose the algorithm to use at runtime.
 A good use of the Strategy pattern would be saving files in different formats, running various sorting algorithms, or file compression.

The Strategy pattern provides a way to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable.
