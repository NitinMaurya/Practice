Another great example of factory method pattern in real life can be:

Notifications to be sent to a customer.

Let's say we have to send different types of notifications to customer based on different kafka events

1. Booking Event 
2. Contact center Event
3. Task Event

What we can do is, create a multiple classes of different notifications to be sent to the customer like 
- your reservation about to start.
- you have been allocated a vehicle.
- your vehicle has been replaced.
- your profile has been approved.

And then we can create a Notification factory which will take these events 
and decide which notification is to be sent by checking the conditions in the event data.

Disadvantage:

Let's say we have hundreds of notifications to be sent but in this case the factory class will have lots of if-else.
So in this case we use strategy pattern.
